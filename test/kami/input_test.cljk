  "The pure half of kami.input — the part that decides what a key or a drag *means*.

   These exist because the regression they cover was invisible for the whole life of the
   library: `:scale` did not exist, so every game whose guest wrote the catalog-standard
   `(set-velocity! p (axis \"MoveX\") (axis \"MoveY\") zero)` moved at 1 world unit per
   second across worlds thousands of units wide. Nothing failed; the player just never
   arrived. A pure unit test on the interpretation is the cheapest place to notice that."
