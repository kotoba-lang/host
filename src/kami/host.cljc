  "Browser host for compiled kami games (the CLJS twin of native kami-script-runtime).

   A game `logic.clj` is compiled to wasm by kototama, then WebAssembly.instantiate'd
   against this import object; its `kami:engine/*` calls read/write a small ECS, and
   its `*-tick` exports run each frame. This is what makes 'edit CLJ → live game' work.

   The ECS is a plain atom of {id → entity} (verified ABI-correct off-GPU in node +
   in-browser). A DataScript/Datomic query+as-of projection is the next layer (it was
   tried in the hot path first but caused subtle read bugs — kept out of the per-call
   path for now). ABI: imports are typed (i32 ptr/len, i64 eid, f32 coords); wasm i64
   crosses to JS as BigInt — eids are BigInt on the wire, keyed by Number here."

;; (realtime fidelity — AABB/circle colliders, impulse resolution + positional

   live here, since the compiled guest can't do f32 arithmetic). No config → unchanged.
